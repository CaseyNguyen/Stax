# Stax

Stax is a mobile budgeting application built for Android and iOS. It is extremely simple to use and allows you to track income and expenses with ease.

## Development

I'm not very good at budgeting, and I've used many applications to attempt to remedy this issue. I have enjoyed aspects of these apps, so accompanied with some true budgeting knowledge, and wanted to make a really easy app to budget with. I identified several user-related issues with apps that I have had in the past which led me to give up use of it. This includes:
- Using recurring values incorrectly (i.e. paychecks).
- Confusing UI.

With that in mind, I drew out wireframes for what I'd want in such an app:

Then, I wanted to select a color palette that would make it clear what each piece of information meant. I used Coolors, a neat tool for generating five-color palettes.
