# Stax

Stax is a mobile budgeting application built for Android and iOS. It is extremely simple to use and allows you to track simple expenses with ease.

## Development

I'm not very good at budgeting, and I've used many applications to attempt to remedy this issue. I have enjoyed aspects of these apps, so accompanied with some true budgeting knowledge, and wanted to make a really easy app to budget with. I identified several user-related issues with apps that I have had in the past which led me to give up use of it. This includes:
- Using recurring values incorrectly (i.e. paychecks).
- Confusing UI.

With that in mind, I drew out wireframes for what I'd want in such an app:

And then I started developing.
